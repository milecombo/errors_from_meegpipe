# errors_from_meegpipe
This repository is meant to upload the txt errors generated when running MEEGPIPE from the server.
This is because the issue functionality of github does not allow to upload anything else than images.
Thus a link to a file.txt (stored under this repository) will be provided in the MEEGPIPE issues from now on.
